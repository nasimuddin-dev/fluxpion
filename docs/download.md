# Download AI Protocol Studio

The current version is **{{ release.version }}**<span v-if="release.date">, released {{ release.date }}</span>. Every installer is self-contained: you don't need Node.js or anything else. The files are hosted on the project's <a :href="release.releaseUrl">GitHub release page</a>, which also lists their SHA-256 checksums.

<Downloads />

## Which file do I need?

- **Windows:** use the **installer**. Choose the **portable** `.exe` if you can't install software; it keeps no shortcuts, but your workspaces and settings are stored the same way.
- **macOS:** choose **Apple Silicon** for Macs with an M-series chip, or **Intel** for older Macs. Apple menu → **About This Mac** shows which one you have.
- **Linux:** the **AppImage** runs on most distributions without installing. Use the **.deb** on Ubuntu and Debian derivatives, or the **.rpm** on Fedora, RHEL and openSUSE, to get a menu entry.
- **CI servers:** use the [`aipstudio` CLI](/installation/cli) instead of the desktop app.

## Before you install

**Code signing.** The installers aren't code-signed yet. Windows SmartScreen may warn you the first time, and macOS asks you to confirm the first launch. The installation guides show exactly what to click.

## Verify a download (optional)

Each release includes `SHA256SUMS.txt`. Compare the checksum of your file with the one listed:

::: code-group

```powershell [Windows]
Get-FileHash .\AIProtocolStudio-*-setup.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

```bash [macOS]
shasum -a 256 AIProtocolStudio-*.dmg
```

```bash [Linux]
sha256sum AIProtocolStudio-*
```
