features:
  - title: REST & GraphQL client
    details: Requests with every common auth type, bodies, cookies, scripts and assertions. GraphQL introspection with schema-aware autocomplete. Large responses stream to disk.
    link: /api-testing/rest
    linkText: API testing
  - title: MCP inspector
    details: Connect over stdio, Streamable HTTP or SSE. Discover tools, resources and prompts, run tools from generated forms, and trace every JSON-RPC message.
    link: /mcp/overview
    linkText: MCP debugging
  - title: AI Lab
    details: Test prompts on OpenAI-compatible, Azure, Anthropic, Gemini, Amazon Bedrock and Ollama models — or an offline mock. Streaming, time to first token, tokens, cost and side-by-side comparison.
    link: /ai-testing/overview
    linkText: AI testing
  - title: Evaluations
    details: Stream datasets through deterministic, semantic and LLM-as-judge evaluators, including RAG, agent tool-use and safety checks. Compare runs against baselines.
    link: /ai-testing/evaluations
    linkText: Evaluation guide
  - title: Test runner & CI
    details: YAML test suites with parallel workers, retries, dependencies and resumable runs. JUnit, JSON, HTML and Markdown reports, and an testpion CLI for any CI system.
    link: /test-runner/overview
    linkText: Test runner
  - title: Monitors & certificates
    details: Run collections on a schedule with alerts, response-time limits, uptime by day and per-request numbers. Every HTTPS response records its certificate, so an expiring one never surprises you.
    link: /test-runner/monitors
    linkText: Monitors
  - title: Charts that explain
    details: A Home dashboard with what needs attention, run charts down to DNS, TCP, TLS and server time, each test's history and the flaky ones, load and monitor trends, and usage of MCP tools and AI models.

    linkText: All features
  - title: Built for AI agents
    details: testpion mcp-server gives agents 59 tools, from sending requests and running tests to what needs attention, with secrets redacted. Every CLI command has --json and the docs publish llms.txt.
    link: /ai-testing/mcp-server
    linkText: MCP server
  - title: Local-first and private
    details: No account and no telemetry. Secrets are encrypted with your OS keychain and redacted from logs, traces and reports. Scripts run in a WebAssembly sandbox.

## Runs on your operating system

TestPion is a desktop app for Windows, macOS and Linux, and every release has installers for each:

| System | Installers |
| --- | --- |
| **Windows** 10 and 11, x64 | Installer (`.exe`) or a portable `.exe` that runs without installing |
| **macOS** 12+ | `.dmg` for Apple Silicon and for Intel |
| **Linux** x86_64 | AppImage, `.deb` and `.rpm` |

The `testpion` command-line runner uses the same engine and runs anywhere Node.js 22+ runs — see [installing the CLI](/installation/cli).

## Local-first by design

- **Your data stays on your machine.** Workspaces are plain files (collections, environments, YAML tests) that you can commit to git. There's no account and no cloud backend.
- **Secrets never touch workspace files.** Tokens and API keys are encrypted with Windows DPAPI, the macOS Keychain or Linux Secret Service, and redacted from every log, trace, report and export.
- **No telemetry.** Requests and prompts go only to the servers and AI providers you call.
- **Deterministic where it matters.** AI-judge and heuristic scores are always labelled, so they're never confused with real assertions.
