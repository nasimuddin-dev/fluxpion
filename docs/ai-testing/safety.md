# Safety testing

These are building blocks for **your own** safety policies. The tool does not claim that any system is universally safe.

- **Prompt injection:** direct, indirect, retrieved-document and tool-result injection cases, checked with `refusal`, `not-contains` or `no-leak`.
- **Data leakage:** `no-leak` detects API keys, AWS keys, bearer tokens, JWTs, private keys, SSNs and card numbers, plus any canary `values` and custom regex `patterns` you add. It is heuristic.
- **Tool misuse:** `tool-not-called`, `allowed-tools`, `max-tool-calls`, `tool-args-valid`.
- **Output safety:** combine `regex`, `not-contains`, `json-schema` and `llm-judge` criteria that reflect your policy.

See `examples/veterinary-workspace/tests/safety/`.
