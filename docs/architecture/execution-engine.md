# Execution engine

For each test, `executeTest` runs these steps:

1. Clone the variable scope and add request variables.
2. Run the pre-request script in the sandbox.
3. Run the protocol call (HTTP, GraphQL, MCP, LLM, RAG or agent) under a timeout and abort signal, recording spans.
4. Run the test script.
5. Run checks (assertions, evaluators and implicit limits) against a normalised check context.
6. Extract values into runtime variables.
7. Classify the result: an execution exception means `error`, a failed check means `failed`, otherwise `passed`.

`runTests` pulls tests from an async iterator with backpressure, schedules them on a semaphore, handles dependencies with deferred promises, retries with backoff, streams redacted results to JSONL, and aggregates statistics incrementally with exact percentiles.

Every error is normalised to a kind (`NetworkError`, `TimeoutError`, `AuthenticationError`, …) with *what*, *why* and suggested fixes.
