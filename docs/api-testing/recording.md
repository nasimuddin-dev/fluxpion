# Record traffic

TestPion can sit between your app and an API as a small reverse proxy on your computer. Point the app at the local address instead of the API, use it as usual, and every request and response shows up in TestPion. Save the recording as a collection: each request becomes a saved request with its response as an [example](/api-testing/collections#examples), ready to replay, turn into tests, or serve from a [mock server](/api-testing/mock-servers).

It's a quick way to document an API you only know through a front end, to reproduce what a browser app sends, or to build a mock from real traffic.

## In the app

Open **Collections** and click the **Record traffic** icon (or **Record traffic** in the command palette, Ctrl+K).

1. Enter the API's base URL, for example `https://api.example.com`, and optionally a local port. Click **Start recording**.
2. TestPion shows (and copies) the local address, such as `http://127.0.0.1:52308`. Use it in your app instead of the API's base URL.
3. Requests appear as they happen: method, path, status and time.
4. Enter a name under **Save as collection** and click **Save**.

The saved collection has a `baseUrl` variable set to the API. Requests are named after their method and path and grouped by the first path segment; a repeated request keeps its other responses as more examples. Browser noise (cookies, `sec-*` headers, `accept-language` …) is left out.

**Secrets never land in the collection.** Tokens, API keys, passwords and similar values in headers, query parameters and form bodies are replaced by `{{variables}}`. The message after saving lists them, so you can add them as secret environment variables.

## From the terminal

```bash
testpion record https://api.example.com --port 8080 -w my-workspace --collection "Recorded"
# Recording https://api.example.com
# Point your client at http://127.0.0.1:8080 (instead of https://api.example.com). Ctrl+C stops and saves the recording.
# 200 GET    /v1/pets?limit=10  84 ms
# 201 POST   /v1/pets  120 ms
```

Without `-w` the exchanges are only printed.

## Good to know

- The proxy listens on `127.0.0.1` only, so nothing outside your computer can use it.
- Browser apps work: CORS preflight requests are answered by the proxy, redirects that point to the API are rewritten to the proxy, and cookies are adjusted (no `Domain`, no `Secure`) so the browser sends them back to the proxy.
- HTTPS APIs work, because your app talks plain HTTP to the proxy and the proxy talks HTTPS to the API. WebSocket upgrades are not recorded.
- Bodies of up to 256 KB are recorded; bigger ones are still forwarded in full. Binary bodies are recorded as their size and type.
